Security Risks: Be aware of the security risks involved in using exposed credentials. Unauthorized access and data breaches are possible if used improperly.
Change Credentials for Private Use: If you need to use this application in a more secure or private setting, please change the database credentials and ensure they are managed securely (e.g., through environment variables or a secure vault solution).
By using this application, you acknowledge the potential risks and agree to take the necessary precautions.
