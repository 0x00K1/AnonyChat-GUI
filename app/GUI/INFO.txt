GDBA (Global Database Application)  
Application that interacts with a database designed for worldwide access. It's built to handle broad, universal tasks and manage data across all users and locations. Think of it as the go-to component for anything that needs a global touch in our app.

LDBA (Local Database Application)
This is the localized counterpart tailored to meet specific, regional, or individual user needs. The LDBA focuses on data operations that are important locally—whether that’s for a single user or a specific group. It's all about providing customized and locally relevant functionalities.

To make sure your LDBA is runnable, don't forget to update your 'config.properties' file with the correct database connection settings. This includes your specific database URL, username, and password.

Thanks.
